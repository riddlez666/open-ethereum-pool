# README
- These files are to help new users understand some of the vague instructions or if you want to see how others have setup there pool.

# JSON FILES
- Have been seperated as they should be with three pool setups added by default, these go with the PPLNS payout our fork uses.
- Some of the stuff int the files is redundant but doesn't matter as its only looking for what is different.

# Accounts
- These files and the startpool.sh are tied together to unlock the pools account to process payments.
